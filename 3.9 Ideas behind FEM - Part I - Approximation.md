# Approximation

- Exact Solution of a PDE:
  - knowing the everywhere value of a function
- Approximate solution of a PDE, two questions
  - what is a best way to approxmate functions that requires only finitely data
  - how do we define an approximation of the solution of a PDE without knowing the solution itself?

# Different approximations

- Finite fourier seriers
- A global polynomial
- Local/piecewise polynomials defined on a subdivision/mesh of the domain

# Why piecewise approximation?

Common found features of PDEs
- may have kinks
- singularities in corners

# Why not Fourier approximation?

Finite Fourier series of the form

$u(x)=\sum{U_ksin(kx)}$

are good approximations only if u(x) is globally smooth

# Why not Taylor approximation?

Only work in the neighborhood

$u(x)=\sum{U_k(x-x_0)^k}$


- Weierstrass approximation theorem
  - Every function that is bounded on an interval (a,b) can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials 
- Function with singularities are not bounded
- In general, if $u(x)$ or one of its derivatives have kinks, then polynomial approximations will be globally bad, not just where the kink is.

# Why piecewise approximation?
- approximation separately on each part
- approximation may be poor on singularities but still be good elsewhere
- resolving kinks and singularities can be done locally
- resolution can be increased using **h-adaptive mesh refinement(AMR)**; a good way to make computations cheaper
(lecture 15)
- polynomial degree can be increased where the solution is smooth - **p-adaptive mesh refinement**; a good way to make things more accurate
- Reasons
  - Accurate & stable
  - flexible: can do h- and p- adaptive mesh refinement
  - relatively easy to represent in **data structures**
