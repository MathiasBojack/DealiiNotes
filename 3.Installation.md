# Obtaining deal.II

tar: short for Tape archive, package all the files in directory  

gz: for gzip, a compression program   

x: extract

v: verbose, give you information about all of the files that you unpack

z: not just a tape archive but also compressed

f: shouldn't take the file from an action tape device

    tar xvzf deal.II-8.0.0.tar.gz

Current development versions, svn, short for subversion, pull the source code from a central repository

    svn checkout https://svn.dealii.org/trunk/deal.II

# Building deal.II

after unpacking, you get three directories:
- source directory 
  - dealII
  - object file generated by Cmake
  - installation file consisting of
    -  libraries
    -  header file

Basic instructions
- Create build directory  
- Determine properties of the system and compilers 
- Compile using cmake
  - name of compiler
  - version of compiler
  - flags set
- Test if everything works


##
    cd deal.II; mkdir build; cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX = /a/b/c ..
    (/a/b/c installation directory)
    (.. source directory=directory one higher )
    make;
    make install
    cd examples/step-1
    cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR  = /a/b/c .; make run
    ( -DDEAL_II_DIR installation directory)
    (. CURRENT DIRECTORY)
    (make run  -> execute the program in the folder)

# Flags for CMake
- installation directory
- source directory
- Paths to PETSc, Trilinos and other libraries
- whether to build documentation locally
- whether to disable or enable multithreading

# Compile using multi processor

    make -j8;
(build 8 job/files at the same time)

    make install
(take all of the object files and put them into the library and install the library and the header files into the final destination)
