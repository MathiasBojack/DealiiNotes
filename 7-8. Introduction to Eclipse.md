# Eclipse

## 1. Advantage using IDE

Modern IDE for C++
- eclipse
- kdevelop
- Xcode
- Micro visual c++

Advantage
- knows whether the variable is defined
- knows the type of varible with auto completion
- rename a variable everywhere
  - local variable renamed only inside the particular function
- keep declaration and definition in syn
  - C++ code in many cases separate the implementation and declaration
- hints on the function arguments
- faster and less mistakes

Eclipse
- largest and most widely used IDE
- opens source and cross platform
- developped by a consortium of all largest software companies
- plugins for 
  - documentation

# 2 C++ with CMake 

    cd /step-1/folder
    
    // tell the compiler the dependencies
    cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/home/mingguan/Documents/Git/deal.II.install .
    // link the object file
    make
    // execution
    make run

# 3. C++ with Eclipse 

files needed:
- *.cc
- CMakeLists.txt

## 3.1. workflow - Bangerth



- import a project
  - Project window
    - right click - new project - makefile project with existing code
    - browse to the folder of the project (ex. step-1)
- Path & symbols setup for C++ general
  - right click the project folder in the project explorer(step-1) - properties - Paths and symbols - includes - Chose GNU C++ in languages
  - add - browse to the directory of the folder where deal.ii is installed - add to all languages and click ok

- strip the comments for further code development 

## 
    cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/dealii/installation/foler /step-1/folder
    make      // link 
    make run  // execute the program

- Add new build targets in eclipse
  - new - all
  - new - clean
  - new - run

## 3.2. Build in separate build directory

eclipse doesn't support well the build directory as a subdirectory of source file. so:
- create a new build directory, which should be in  parallel to the source file folder
- specify cmake and generate Eclipse CDT4 project files

### Generate the make files for the project
    mkdir /path/of/build/directory
    cmake /source/file/folder -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
### Import the project
- To import this in Eclipse do the following:

    File -> Import -> Existing code as Makefile project

## 3.3. Use the plugin **cmake4eclipse** to generate automatically the cmakefiles accordingto CMakeLists.txt

- File - new - project - C++ project
- Project type - CMake driven - Empty project
- Toolchains - CMake driven

## 3.4 Use commandline to generate profiles

- prepare project files for the eclipse IDE using option "-G"
```
    cd /pjt/path
    cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/dealII/install/path /src/path -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles"
```
- In Eclipse, do
  - file - import - General - Existing projects into workspace - select root directory

## 4. tricks & shortcuts
- ctrl + o: to navigate to a specific function
- ctrl + space: autocompletion
- alt + shift + R: rename a variable name


## 5. Eclipse bugs

- sometimes the console stop showing messages
  - restart to fix this error.
