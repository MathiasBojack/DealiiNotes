# How do we find an approximation of the solution of a PDE without knowing the solution itself?

# mathematical abstraction

- Every piecewise linear function can be writtern in the form:
- need to know the coefficient $U_j$
$u_h=\sum_h^N U_j\varphi_j(x)$

# Idea 2: use the Weak solutions

- starting point?
  - we only know how to compare numbers but not functions
  - when we say that two functions are equal $h(x)=g(x)$, what do you mean?
    - equal for every x
    - equal for almost every x?

- solution
  - turn the equation $h(x)=g(x)$ into an infinite number of comparision of numbers.
  - Here, we say $g=h$ if 

    $F_1(g)=F_1(h)$

    $F_2(g)=F_2(h)$

    $F_3(g)=F_3(h)$

    $...$
 for an infinite number of appropriate functionals
 - The approximate functionals depend on what kinds of g and h we consider 
 - example 1
   - we say $g=h$  in [0,1] if

    $\int_0^1g(x)dx = \int_0^1f(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1xg(x)dx = \int_0^1xf(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1x^2g(x)dx = \int_0^1x^2f(x)dx$

    $...$

- example 2, Fourier expansion
   - we say $g=h$  in [0,1] if

    $\int_0^1g(x)dx = \int_0^1f(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1sin(\pi x)g(x)dx = \int_0^1sin(\pi x)f(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1cos(\pi x)g(x)dx = \int_0^1cos(\pi x)f(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1sin(2\pi x)g(x)dx = \int_0^1sin(2\pi x)f(x)dx$

    $\int_0^1cos(2\pi x)g(x)dx = \int_0^1cos(2\pi x)f(x)dx$
    

    $...$

# Idea 2: use the weak formulation to find an approximative solution

  -  PDE 

        $A(u)=f$
  
  - strong formulation
    
    $\int_\Omega A(u)\cdot \varphi = \int_\Omega f\cdot \varphi; \forall \varphi$

  - weak formulation
  
    $\int_\Omega A(u)\cdot \varphi =$

    $\int_\Omega A_1(u)\cdot A_2(\varphi) + boundary \;terms= \int_\Omega f\cdot \varphi; \forall \varphi$

  - use weak formulation to find an approximate solution:
    
    find $u_h=\sum_h^N U_j\varphi_j(x)$ such that:

    $\int_\Omega A_1(u_h)\cdot A_2(\varphi) + boundary \;terms= \int_\Omega f\cdot \varphi; \forall \varphi$

# Idea 3: Restrict the test functions in the weak formulation
- same test functons as the trial functions
- The Galerkin method

# Notations

$(g,h)=\int_\Omega g(x) h(x) dx$

- the weak solution:

find $u_h=\sum_h^N U_j\varphi_j(x)$ such that:

$\int_\Omega A_1(u_h)\cdot A_2(\varphi_h) + boundary \;terms= \int_\Omega f\cdot \varphi_h; \forall \varphi_h=\sum_{k=1}^N c_k \varphi_k$

in short:

$(A_1(u_h), A_2(\varphi_h))=(\varphi_h,f); \forall \varphi_h=\sum_{k=1}^N c_k \varphi_k$

# More questions

- Question 3: Error, Is uh close to u? 
- Question 4: Convergence: Does uh of the Galerkin method converge towards u in some useful sense as the mesh size reduces?
- Question 5: What is the computational effort to reach a certain accuracy? Optimality
