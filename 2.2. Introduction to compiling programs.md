# Compiling programs under Linux env

## 1.Buiding an app in 2 step

- step 1: compile cc to .o p
  - '-c': compile
  - '-o': output path, filename
- "Link" all .o objective files into one executable

    c++ -c a.cc -o a.o
    c++ -c b.cc -o b.o
    c++ a.o b.o -o myprog

- tricks when calling a function that's not defined in the cpp file of the main function:
  - declare the function in the cpp file of the main function and then define the function in another file


a.cpp:

    #include <iostream>
    void foo()   // function definition
    {
        std::cout<<"Hello world" << std::endl;
    }y

b.cpp

    void foo() // function declaration
    int main()
    {
        foo();
    }

## 2.Errors

- compiler errors
  - c++ syntax
  - variable not declared
  - function not declared
- linker errors
  - function declared but not implemented
- erros often "cascade"
  - start solving the error at the top
  - use the following command to show less errors

rg    c++ -c a.cc -o a.o 2>&1 | less
  - '2>&1' redirects stderr outstream to stdout stream, so that 
it can serve as an input to 'less'

## 3. Automating compilation/linking

- The two step approach is:
  - tedious
  - difficult to get right with "dependencies"
- solution:
  - write rules for a program called "make", then call it:
  
  make myprog

- Content of makefiles:
  - "targets"
    - what should be done
  - "dependencies"
    - what does a target depend on
  - "rules" 
    - how should a taget be created
  - variables and generic rules to make writing rues easier 

Makefile:
- setup three rules:
- 'a.o : a.cc': object file a.o depend on the source file a.cc
- the next line starts with a 'tab'
- files will only be compiled again when the objective file is older than the source file

```
    a.o : a.cc
        c++ -c a.cc -o a.o
    b.o : a.cc
        c++ -c b.cc -o b.o
    hello : a.o b.o
        c++ a.o b.o -o hello
```

Problem with Makefiles

- make is not widely usable under windows
- complex and unreadable for large projects
- not platform independent
- not meant as input for tools other than make
  - tools such as visual sutdio/ eclipse nned to understand where are all the source files of the project: headers...
  - Makefile tells about the dependency, but not such information
