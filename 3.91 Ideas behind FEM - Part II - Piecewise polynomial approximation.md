# Global polynomial approximation

- interpolation of function $f(x)$ on an interval [a,b]
- interpolant $f_p(x)$
  - has polynomial degree p
  - $f_p(x_i)=f(x_i), i=1...p$
- Theorem:

Assume that f is p+1 times continously differentiable, then independent of the choice of the points $x_i$:

$max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-f_p(x)|\leq\frac{max_{x\in[a,b]}|f^{(p)}(x)|}{p!}(b-a)^p$

- assume that

    $max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-f_p(x)|\leq C(f,p)(b-a)^p$
  - if the constant C(f,p) does not grow to quickly, the max error tends to 0 as p grows
- problem: there are functions for which C(f,p) grows quickly
  - polynomial approximant is not guaranteed to converge
  - whether the global interpolant converges to f depends on the function we try to approximate
# Piecewise polynomial approximation

- keep p constant and split the interval into n pieces
- theorem:



$max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-f_p(x)|\leq\frac{max_{x\in[a,b]}|f^{(p)}(x)|}{p!}(b-a)^p\frac{1}{n^p}$

- When p is a constant, the maximal difference converge to 0 as the number of division increases

- Diameter of intervals/cells: $h$


$max_{x\in[a,b]}|f(x)-f_p(x)|\leq\frac{max_{x\in[a,b]}|f^{(p)}(x)|}{p!}h^p$

- L2 norm,$C_1,C_2$ are constants
  - Average error of the function will tend to converge as the mesh size is reduced

$||f-f_{h,p}||=(\int_a^b|f(x)-f_{h,p}(x)|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq \frac{C_1(f,p,a,b)}{p!}h^{p+1}$

- Energy/Gradient/Semi norm
  - Average error of the function gradient will tend to converge as the mesh size is reduced
$||\nabla f-\nabla f_{h,p}||=(\int_a^b|\nabla f(x)-\nabla f_{h,p}(x)|^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}\leq \frac{C_2(f,p,a,b)}{p!}h^{p}$
