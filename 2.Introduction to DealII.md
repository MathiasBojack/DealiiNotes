# Math tools

- Linear algebra in deal.II
  - sub-library for dense + sparse linear algebra
    - Unstructured Multi-frontal linear solver package
    - go-to solver for a linear system on a single processor
    - need a lot of memory
  - Interfaces to PETSC, Trilinos, UMFPACK (US National labs )
- Pre- and postprocessing 
  - read most mesh formats
  - write almost any visualization file format
  
- Parallelization on :
- Single machine
  - use threads and tasks
- Cluster
  - MPI
  - up to 10,000 processors
