FEM lecture - Wolfgang Bangerth FM lectures

# Lecture 1. Course Overview


## 1.1. Goal of this class

- software library for FM computing
- scientific computing
- modern software development tools
- software development practice

- IDE
- Visualization tools
- Tools for documentation


## 1.2. Reference

Finite element method:
- Brenner & Scott:
  - The mathematical theory of finite element methods
- Braess (application):
  - Finite elements

Stroustrup:
- The C++ programming language

## 1.2. Why to use existing software
Why:
- new computational methods
- non-standard problems

How:
- Build from scratch: costly
- Build from existing components
- Adapt code for similar application
  

## 1.3. Standard tools for PDEs

- FEM
- FVM
- FDM
  
Common feature:
- split the domain into small volumes
- define balance relations on each cell
- Large linear system

Multidisciplinary knowledge
- Discretisation
- Linear solver/ preconditionner
- data structure
- parallel computation

We need state-of-the-art techniques!
- multigrid solvers
- adaptive mesh
- Quadratic or even higher order elements
- scalability to 1000 of processors
- efficient use of current hardware
- graphical output suitable for high quality rendering

 ## 1.4. How to develop software

 - The only way to make an impact is to reuse existing libraries

Existing software:

Basic linear algebra (dense vectors, matrices)
- BLAS
- LAPACK
- 
Parallel linear algebra (vectors, sparse matrices, solvers)
- PETSc
- Trilinos
- 
Meshes, finite elements, etc:
- deal.II
- 
Visualization
Dealing with parameter files

## 1.5. Cons and pros for using existing packages

- do by yourself will start linearly quickly in the beginning
- use existing software will start exponentially  
- cross-over point after 2-4 weeks

## 1.6. Desired results

- Works in 2d and 3d
- Complex geometry
- higher order fem
- multigrid solvers or preconditioners
- solves a nonlinear, time-dependent prob

Starting from scratch takes 10 years

## 1.7. Real approach

- practice with 2d case and throw it away
- use other's code for 3d case


 ## 1.8. About bugs

- packages are developed by professionals with a lot of experience
- deal.ii 2700 tests
- high quality and open-source
